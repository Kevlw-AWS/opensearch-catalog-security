## OpenSearch Catalog

The OpenSearch Catalog is designed to make it easier for developers and community to contribute, search and install artifacts like plugins, visualization dashboards, ingestion to visualization content packs (data pipeline configurations, normalization, ingestion, dashboards). The OpenSearch Catalog does this by providing a searchable catalog of community contributed OpenSearch artifacts and [projects](https://opensearch.org/community_projects) that users can browse, rate and download from the project website, OpenSearch CLI, and OpenSearch Dashboards. Users can install and update artifacts with a single click from OpenSearch Dashboards or by running an install/update command from OpenSearch CLI. When the artifacts have updates, they are highlighted in OpenSearch Dashboards to help users discover the latest versions of artifacts.

We are requesting comments on our [RFC](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-catalog/issues/1).
